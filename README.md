A project to develop smart contracts that meet SEC requirements for legal investment vehicles.

## Problem

Businesses want new options to raise capital, consumers want to invest in the brands they trust, and institutional investors want alternative (uncorrelated) assets to diversify their holdings.

The crypto solutions to these problems are beleaguered by, volatility, fraud, and market manipulation.

It's time to build a new financial ecosystem that combines the protections of SEC regulation with the efficiency, security and liquidity of digital assets.

## The new Financial Ecosystem Needs…

* New (legal) tools for capitalizing business: SEC-registered Security Token Offerings (STOs)
* A regulated, compliance-first exchange for digital asset
* A pipeline of credible businesses with large audiences and “tribal” power to drive exchange adoption and velocity
* A market facilitator to prepare companies for the compliance requirements of a public offering
* A marketplace for the Insumer* to purchase public shares
